#### Coding

[Meetup link](http://www.meetup.com/Berkshire-County-Technology-Group/events/161596012/)

I want to have other meetings that will be on softer topics but this meeting
will be focused on programming. That said, please come if you are interested in
learning!

Agenda: We could start by sharing any interesting projects we're working on,
then (depending on number of people) we could break up into pairs or larger
groups to do code review, pairing programming or katas.

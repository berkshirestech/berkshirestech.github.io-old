### Designer/Developer meetup

This week's meeting will have a different format than usual. We will be playing
a programming/physics game with [USB rocket
launchers](http://www.dreamcheeky.com/thunder-missile-launcher). We will break
into teams and write programs that teach the rocket launchers to shoot at
targets when given some basic measurements. Then, toward the end of the meeting
we will test out the programs. All in about 2 hours!

For more information read on:

### Thunder Missile Challenge

#### Goal

Write a program which can get a USB missile launcher to fire darts at targets
using a json file containing targeting information. The targeting information
will be based on easy to measure angles and distances, but the challenge is that
the native API speaks only in turning and tilting directions and time periods.
To accomplish the goal, you’ll need to be able to translate the high level
information into the low level API. You will need some minor (easily googleable)
physics and geometry knowledge.

#### Details

We have two USB rocket launchers, and will have computers with a basic node
application with the API included. There will be two teams, each working
independently to write an application which can read the targeting data from a
file and then immediately try to shoot the targets. Teams will be given 90
minutes to write the application before the final test. The final test will have
targets set up with targeting data, and each team will take turns using the same
targeting data to try to hit as many targets as accurately as possible. The team
with the better score wins.

#### Useful Knowledge

There is no required knowledge or abilities for this other than critical
thinking/problem solving. Each team will have at least one member with the
necessary coding ability, but it would be great to get some team programming
going. If you wanted to brush up on anything to be prepared, here are some
things that would be helpful:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is the platform we will be using to talk to the launcher.
- Node uses the JavaScript language, so that would be helpful, even if you have
no prior Node experience.
- A little bit of knowledge about angles, geometry, and some basic physics will be
needed to get the job done. Internet access is available while writing the app,
so you’ll be able to look up whatever you need, but it might help to have a
basic understanding of the factors (for example, the role of gravity).

### Tinkering, coding or just general geeking

[Meetup link](http://www.meetup.com/Berkshire-County-Technology-Group/events/158906502/)

No set agenda. I'll bring my box of Arduino boards and breadboards to tinker
with, but if anyone would rather focus on coding (talking shop, pair
programming, etc.) I'm up for that as well. Also more than happy to just talk
about science fiction or philosophy.

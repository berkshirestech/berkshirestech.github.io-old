### Digital Fabrication & 3D Art

[Meetup link](http://www.meetup.com/Berkshire-County-Technology-Group/events/159063332/)

[More information here ](http://pittsfieldlibrary.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/digital-fabrication-3d-art-presentation-on-tuesday-february-4/) on the Pittsfield library website.

Group member Phil Webster is going to be talking about his artwork at an event
at the Pittsfield Athenaeum scheduled through the Friends of the Berkshire
Athenaeum. I'll be giving a short presentation beforehand. The description is
below:

Digital fabrication techniques, often referred to as "3D protoyping" or "3D
printing" are quickly becoming affordable at a consumer level, and are
frequently featured in today's headlines. But, what exactly is 3D printing, how
does it work, and what can it be used for? Come hear about the basics of how
this technology works, including a variety of practical applications, and then
see some real life examples of mathematical artwork created by local artist
Phil Webster using these processes.

#### Play with Arduinos and breadboards

[Meetup link](http://www.meetup.com/Southern-Berkshires-Technology-Group/events/149030792/)

We'll be creating basic programs to run on the Arduino board connected to a
breadboard. If you're not familiar with what an Arduino or a breadboard are
we'll be happy to bring you up to speed (we're just beginners ourselves). Also
as before let me know if Saturday is better than Sunday for you.
